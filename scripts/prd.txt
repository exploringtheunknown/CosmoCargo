# Intergalactic Chaos Engineâ„¢ PRD

## Overview
Build a Chaos Engine for the CosmoCargo platform that periodically mutates shipments with random galactic events, logs the impact, and provides real-time updates to the admin frontend.

## Requirements
- Every X seconds, a random shipment is mutated by a chaos event.
- Events are chosen using weighted probabilities, influenced by shipment category.
- Each event mutates the shipment in the database and logs the impact.
- All events are persisted in a ChaosEventLog table for audit and frontend display.
- Admin frontend receives real-time updates via SignalR (Galactic Event Feed).
- Admins can enable/disable the chaos engine via UI/API.
- All chaos engine controls and logs are admin-only.
- Configuration (interval, probabilities) is adjustable.

## Example Chaos Events
- Meteor Shower: Causes a delay
- Wormhole: Redirects destination
- Pirate Attack: Weight set to 0
- Virus in Biosensor: Lifeform flag set to "Unstable"
- Black Hole Nearby: Status set to "Lost in Black Hole"
- AI Uprising: Pilot and destination set to "Unknown"

## Components
1. Data model & migration for ChaosEventLog
2. Chaos event engine (event definitions, probability mapping, mutation logic)
3. BackgroundService scheduler
4. SignalR hub for real-time updates
5. API endpoints for event log and admin control
6. Admin control UI/logic (frontend)
7. Configuration (interval, probabilities)
8. Security (admin-only access)
9. Tests for each component

## Non-Functional
- Extensible for new events and categories
- Secure (admin-only)
- Efficient and scalable
