# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Chaos Event Engine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the logic for generating random events based on weighted probabilities.
# Details:
Create a service that generates events. Use a weighted random selection algorithm to choose an event.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for the event generation logic.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Weighted Random Selection Algorithm [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a function that selects an event based on its weighted probability.
### Details:
Develop the algorithm in a separate file. Ensure it can handle multiple events and their respective weights.

## 2. Implement Event Generation Service [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Build a service that uses the weighted random algorithm to generate an event.
### Details:
Create a RESTful API endpoint that triggers the event generation. Store events in a database for future reference.

## 3. Configure and Test Event Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Set up the backend to run the event generation service and test it with different inputs.
### Details:
Deploy the service in a development environment. Run end-to-end tests to ensure events are generated as expected.
