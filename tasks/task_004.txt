# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement BackgroundService Scheduler
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a scheduler that triggers chaos events at specified intervals.
# Details:
Use IHostedService or BackgroundService to schedule the event generation logic. Ensure it runs as a service.

# Test Strategy:
Test the scheduler with different intervals and verify it triggers events as expected.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create BackgroundService Interface [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define an interface for the background service that will handle chaos event scheduling.
### Details:
Create an IHostedService or BackgroundService interface with a method to schedule chaos events at specified intervals. Use Dependency Injection to manage dependencies.

## 2. Implement Scheduling Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Develop the logic that implements the scheduling of chaos events based on user-defined intervals.
### Details:
Create a concrete implementation of the BackgroundService interface. Use the System.Threading.Timer or similar library to handle periodic execution of chaos events.

## 3. Integrate with Chaos Event Engine [done]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Ensure the background service interacts properly with the Chaos Event Engine to generate and execute chaos events.
### Details:
Implement methods in the concrete BackgroundService class that interact with the Chaos Event Engine to schedule and trigger events. Ensure proper error handling and logging for event failures.
