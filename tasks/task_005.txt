# Title: Implement SignalR Hub for Real-Time Updates
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up a SignalR hub to send real-time updates about chaos events.
# Details:
Create a SignalR hub that broadcasts event information. Ensure it can handle multiple clients.

# Test Strategy:
Test the hub with multiple instances and verify real-time updates.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create SignalR Hub Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the interface and methods that the SignalR hub will provide for broadcasting event information.
### Details:
Implement an interface with methods like 'BroadcastEvent' to handle the sending of real-time updates. Use interfaces to define the contract for any implementing classes.

## 2. Implement SignalR Hub Class [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create a concrete implementation of the SignalR hub that uses the defined interface to broadcast event information.
### Details:
Develop a class that implements the previously defined interface and integrates with the SignalR core library to handle client connections and message broadcasting.

## 3. Configure SignalR in Application [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Integrate the SignalR hub into the application's configuration and ensure it starts up correctly when the application launches.
### Details:
Add the necessary configuration to your application to register the SignalR hub. Ensure that the hub is accessible from the frontend through appropriate routing and middleware setup.
