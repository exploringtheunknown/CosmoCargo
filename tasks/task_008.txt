# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Configuration Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add a feature to adjust the interval and probabilities of chaos events dynamically.
# Details:
Create an admin interface or API endpoints to update configuration settings. Ensure it persists changes in the database.

# Test Strategy:
Test the configuration management with different values and verify they affect event behavior.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Configuration API Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create RESTful API endpoints to receive configuration updates for chaos event intervals and probabilities.
### Details:
Use a backend framework like Spring Boot or Express.js. Define endpoints such as PUT /config/interval and PUT /config/probability. Ensure proper validation and error handling.

## 2. Persist Configuration Changes in Database [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Modify the backend logic to save configuration changes to a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) whenever an API endpoint is called.
### Details:
Use ORM tools like Hibernate or Mongoose. Ensure that each configuration setting is saved with a timestamp to track when it was last updated.

## 3. Develop Admin Interface for Configurations [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Create an admin interface or use an existing one to allow administrators to view and update chaos event configurations.
### Details:
Use a frontend framework like React or Angular. Develop forms that display the current configuration settings and update them through the API endpoints implemented in subtask 1.
